The version I sent to you is hard-coded inputs. You need to change the input parameters
for your input. 
 
To run lidar-GORT model:
gfortran gort_lidar.f90 gort_lidar_main.f90 -o gort_lidar

./gort_lidar 

Outputs saved in gort.out include:
leaf orientation factor and clumping factor: G,gamma,
Vertical profiles:
fp 	! foliage profile 
efp, 	! effective foliage profile G*gamma*foliage profile
pgap, 	! gap probability
dpdz, 	! dp/dz
wvfm	! waveforms

The output from gort_lidar has no-gaussian smooth. I usually run a gaussian smooth using idl.
I also include the idl code to do gaussian smooth to modeled waveform. 

Convolute GORT-modeled waveform with gaussian pulse, check run_gort.pro for details

You could also make the code more professional by read an input file. See detail below: 
This approach may make it easier for user. 


The input include one or two or more layers/plant function types (pfts).
pft follows  CLM 16 plant function types:
  !1: needleleaf_evergreen_temperate_tree   
  !2: needleleaf_evergreen_boreal_tree      
  
  !3: needleleaf_deciduous_boreal_tree      
  
  !4: broadleaf_evergreen_tropical_tree     
  !5: broadleaf_evergreen_temperate_tree    
  
  !6: broadleaf_deciduous_tropical_tree     
  !7: broadleaf_deciduous_temperate_tree    
  !8: broadleaf_deciduous_boreal_tree       
  
  !9: broadleaf_evergreen_shrub             
  !10:broadleaf_deciduous_temperate_shrub   
  !11:broadleaf_deciduous_boreal_shrub      
  
  !12:c3_arctic_grass                       
  !13:c3_non-arctic_grass                   
  !14:c4_grass                              
  
  !15:crop 1: e.g.corn                                  
  !16:crop 2: e.g.wheat                                 
 
The inputs are something like saved in gort.in:

The meanings of these parameters are gort_input structure:
  type gort_input
     real :: dens_tree         ! Crown count density (m-2)
     real :: dens_foliage      ! foliage area volume density of a single crown(m-1)
     real :: h1, h2            ! lower and upper bound of crown centers (m)
     real :: dz                ! height increase for each height level
     real :: horz_radius       ! horizontal crown radius (m)
     real :: vert_radius       ! vertical crown radius (m)
     real :: zenith            ! solar zenith angle (degree)
     real :: rhol              ! leaf reflectance
     real :: taul              ! leaf transmittance
     real :: rhos              ! background albedo 
     integer :: pft            ! plant function type
  end type gort_input
